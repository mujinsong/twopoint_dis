# twopoint_dis
The distance between two points is measured by realsense and opencv and QR code

Paste a QR code on an object, press 'q', the program will record a point above the QR code when the first click, when the object moves to where you want, press 'q' to record as the second time, and then the program will calculate the distance between the two points (3D)

在一个物体上贴上一个二维码,按'q',程序会记录第一次点击时二维码上方的一点,当物体移动到你想要的地方时,按下'q',记录为第二次,然后程序会计算出两点之间的距离(3D)
